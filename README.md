# First-Steps
Mini-projects created during university study-process back in 2018-2019. 

LAB#2. Creating a class BBST (Balanced Binary Search Tree) and experimenting with its objects.
Aims: 
-	Learn how to define and implement class BBST that includes such basic methods: isEmpty(), isFull(), size(), addItem(), deleteItem(), search(), rintTree_preorder(),printTree_inorder(),printTree_postorder().
-	Learn how to create objects of this class of a necessary configuration and how to manipulate such objects. 
-	Learn how to adjust available methods or design additional methods of BBST class (like printing tree items in ascending order or descending order, etc.). 
-	Practice in creating and using dynamic objects.
Note: After application of any method to a BBST object,  the resulting tree must remain balanced. Use AVL approach to balancing binary trees.
 Tasks:
-	Design a C++ (JavaScript/C#)  program that defines:
a.	 BBST class with integer data items (only!). 
b.	main() function which declares an object of BBST class and calls some methods of this class. 
-	After calling any method by the object, print the resulting content of your tree object for verifying the operation result.                           
-	Be ready to make a tree diagram by the tree content printing and vice versa.
-	Be ready to make additional BBST methods similar to the methods from the list to follow. 
-	Make sure that your methods are time- and memory-effective. 
-	Be ready to estimate time-efficiency of your methods.
